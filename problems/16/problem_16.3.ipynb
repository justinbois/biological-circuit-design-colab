    "Lengyel and Morelli ([PRE, 2017](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.95.042412)) considered a model for regulation of gene expression that may lead to bursty expression. The authors noted that many genes occurring in organisms from bacteria to humans are autorepressed, and furthermore that clusters of binding sites for the same transcription factor also commonly occur. They then proposed a simple model for the production of an autorepressed gene, shown below.\n",

    "The protein gene product is made with a rate $r(m)$, where $m$ is the number of proteins bound to the $N$ identical binding sites near the promoter. The binding is reversible with binding and unbinding rates respectively being $k_b$ and $k_u$. Finally, the bound proteins decay with rate $d_b$ and free proteins decay with rate $d_f$. To complete the notation, we define the number of unbound proteins in a cell as $n$.\n",

For all of our simulations, we will take $k_b = k_u = 335.5$. We will also take $\\gamma = 1$ (except for part (f), see below).  We will consider various values of $N$ and $M$. That is, we will look at how the number of binding sites and the threshold for repression affect bursty expression and noise. With these parameters set, the value of $r_0$ is set such that the long-time average total number of proteins, $n_t = m + n$, is (approximately) 20. We do this so that we can make clear comparisons between parameter sets; we want them all to have the same average expression level and we can then explore bursty dynamics and noise. Finding the values of $r_0$ to enforce that the long-time averages are all about 20 is nontrivial, and we have done that for you. You can download relevant parameter sets [here](autorepression_params.csv).\n",

    "Now that you know how to access parameters, you can code up and run a simulation. For your first simulation, use the parameter set $N = 5$, $M = 0$, and $\\gamma = 1$. Since $M = 0$, expression is shut down if any proteins are bound to any of the binding sites. Perform a Gillespie simulation starting with $n = m = 0$ going from time $t = 0$ to $t = 30$. Compute the total number of protein products ($n_t = m + n$) over time. Plot the result. Do you see bursts?\n",

We assumed that the inter-burst times were exponentially distributed, which gives that the number of proteins is negative binomially distributed. Based on the burst sizes and inter-burst times you computed, do you think they are respectively geometrically and exponentially distributed in this model?\n",

Now you can simulate that experiment. Perform 200 Gillespie simulations up to time $t = 20$. You now have samples of the number of proteins, $n_t$, in  200 \"cells\" at time $t = 20$. Do these values appear to be negative binomially distributed?\n",

    "- ii) We will now look at how the threshold number of bound sites before repression affects now. Say we have $N = 14$ binding sites, again with $\\gamma = 1$. Compute $\\eta$ for $M \\in [0, 14]$ and plot the result. Are there values for $M$ for which the noise is lower than the single binding site ($N=1$) case?\n",
