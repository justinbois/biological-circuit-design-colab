    "Gardner and Collins built their toggle switch so that one can manually push the circuit into a desired state via the addition of an external signal. We did not discuss how such a control mechanism might be implemented in the positive autoregulation circuit we analyzed in this chapter. Consider some possible molecular implementations of such a \"control knob\" that could be built into the positive autoregulation circuit to allow a user to toggle the circuit between its high and low fixed points."
