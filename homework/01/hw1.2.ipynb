    "In this problem, we will explore a very simple circuit: autoactivation of a single gene, shown in the figure below.  We will assume a separation of time scales in mRNA and protein degradation/dilution such that we only need to consider the dynamics of the protein, and we will call its concentration $x$.  We will further assume that the autoactivation effect can be modeled as a Hill function with Hill coefficient $n$.\n",

    "**a)** Write down an ODE describing the dynamics of $x$. Include leakage parametrized by $\\alpha$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**b)** Show that for $n = 1$, only one steady state exists for $\\alpha > 0$. Show further that when $\\alpha = 0$, two steady states may exist, but only one is stable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**c)** In part (b), we considered the case where activation is not cooperative. We now consider the other extreme, where activation is infinitely cooperative. Derive the condition for bistability when $n\\to\\infty$.  In other words, for what parameter values does the circuit exhibit two stable steady states? Discuss this condition as it relates to design principles for bistability."
