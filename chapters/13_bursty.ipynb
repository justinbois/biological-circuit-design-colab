    "In the last lesson, we laid out two objectives. First, we aimed to identify the sources of noise and how to characterize them. We summarized statistics about the probability distribution of copy numbers by considering the mean and coefficient of variation. The mean ends up following the same deterministic dynamics we have been considering thus far in the course. The coefficient of variation is a measure of noise, or relative departure from the mean behavior. Now, we will look at the dynamics of the entire probability distribution of copy number, $P(n,t)$."

In our case, the \"state\" is the set of copy numbers of molecular species of interest. The values of $n$ are discrete, so we have a separate differential equation for each $P(n,t)$.

There is also the computational difficulty that $n$ can be very large. In general, solving the master equation is difficult and is usually intractable analytically.  Therefore, we *sample* out of the distribution. That is, we can draw many samples of values of $n$ at time points $t$ that are distributed according to the probability distribution that solves the master equation. We can then plot histograms to get an approximate plot of the probability distribution.  We can also use the samples to compute moments, giving us estimates of the mean and variance. Generating the samples from the *differential* master equation is done using a *Gillespie algorithm*, also known as a *stochastic simulation algorithm*, or SSA.  We will learn how to do these calculations in the next lesson."
